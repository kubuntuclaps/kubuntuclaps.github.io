      <description>Welcome to the new episode of my cracking series, today we will see how i cracked 90% (or even more) of the steam library with a simple thing.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started Well, i downloaded Sonic Generations from our seven seas website, and i see the crack is a .DLL file (steam_api.dll) which 1337 people archieve the way of emulate it (and get online functions)&amp;hellip;
How the file works? In a simple way, it emulates steam and spoofs the GameID which is a number to identify the game XD and spoofs it into Spacewar.</description>
