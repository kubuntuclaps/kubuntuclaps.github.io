      <description>Hi! In the previous chapter we tried to crack a CD protected game, which i failed in the attempt so, i really wanted to crack myself this game so i had a good idea&amp;hellip;
I had bought the game on steam, so why not crack the steam version? Don&amp;rsquo;t waste any more time and let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Files I created a copy outside of steamapps folder (in case of something bad happens) and closed my steam session.</description>
